{"id": 2, "text": "(CNN)A Duke student has admitted to hanging a noose made of rope from a tree near a student union, university officials said Thursday. The prestigious private school didn't identify the student, citing federal privacy laws. In a news release, it said the student was no longer on campus and will face student conduct review. The student was identified during an investigation by campus police and the office of student affairs and admitted to placing the noose on the tree early Wednesday, the university said. Officials are still trying to determine if other people were involved. Criminal investigations into the incident are ongoing as well. Students and faculty members marched Wednesday afternoon chanting \"We are not afraid. We stand together,\"  after pictures of the noose were passed around on social media. At a forum held on the steps of Duke Chapel, close to where the noose was discovered at 2 a.m., hundreds of people gathered. \"You came here for the reason that you want to say with me, 'This is no Duke we will accept. This is no Duke we want. This is not the Duke we're here to experience. And this is not the Duke we're here to create,' \" Duke President Richard Brodhead told the crowd. The incident is one of several recent racist events to affect college students. Last month a fraternity at the University of Oklahoma had its charter removed after a video surfaced showing members using the N-word and referring to lynching in a chant. Two students were expelled. In February, a noose was hung around the neck of a statue of a famous civil rights figure at the University of Mississippi. A statement issued by Duke said there was a previous report of hate speech directed at students on campus. In the news release, the vice president for student affairs called the noose incident a \"cowardly act.\" \"To whomever committed this hateful and stupid act, I just want to say that if your intent was to create fear, it will have the opposite effect,\" Larry Moneta said Wednesday.

Bush called it \"disgraceful.\" There's nothing quite like getting the presidential thumbs down. One of the most controversial and beloved versions of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" comes from 1969. Guitar slinger Jimi Hendrix inflamed mainstream America with his psychedelic take on the national anthem to the delight of the Woodstock generation. And then there's Michael Bolton's version.

Turkey is known as the easiest place from which to enter Syria and join ISIS. An ISIS manual advises recruits to buy round-trip tickets to vacation spots such as Spain and then purchase tickets for their real destination once they arrive overseas, the FBI said.

It started at 3:16 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time, when the moon began moving into Earth's shadow.  For the next hour and 45 minutes, that shadow will move across the moon and engulf it at 4:58 a.m. Pacific Time. The total eclipse will only last four minutes and 43 seconds, and NASA says that makes it the shortest one of the century. Watch it live on NASA TV . While people west of the Mississippi River will have the best view, at least a partial eclipse will be visible across the nation. But sunrise will interrupt the show on the East Coast. Parts of South America, India, China and Russia also will be able to see the eclipse, but it won't be visible in Greenland, Iceland, Europe, Africa or the Middle East. A lunar eclipse happens when the sun, Earth and moon form a straight line in space, with the Earth smack in the middle. The sun shines on the Earth and creates a shadow. As the moon moves deeper into that shadow, it appears to turn dark and may even appear to be a reddish color.  Why red? Because Earth's atmosphere is filtering out most of the blue light. Some people have nicknamed the effect the \"blood moon.\" NASA says lunar eclipses typically happen at least twice a year, but this eclipse is the third in a series of four in a row, known as a \"tetrad.\"  The first was on April 15, 2014.

The committee will examine the equipment used to measure the temperature, whether it was in good working order, whether the correct monitoring procedures were followed, whether the equipment was placed in the correct location and whether the measurement is matched by corresponding records from surrounding stations, Cerveny said.

Kim Ki-Jong has also been charged with assaulting a foreign envoy and business obstruction, the Seoul Central District Court official said. According to South Korean law, Kim's trial must begin within 14 days of receiving today's indictment. Lippert was stabbed March 5 during an event organized by the Korean Council for Reconciliation and Cooperation, which advocates peaceful reunification between North and South Korea. Shortly before Lippert was supposed to give a speech, the attacker slashed him in the face and jaw. The ambassador suffered a gash from his right cheekbone to his lower jaw that required 80 stitches. That wound measured 10 centimeters (4 inches) long and 2.5 centimeters (1 inch) deep, but there was no serious facial nerve damage, said Dr. Jung Nam-shik of the Yonsei Severance Hospital. Lippert also suffered five cuts in his left arm and hand, but was not expected to have permanent damage to his arm function. Police said Kim stabbed Lippert with a 10-inch knife because he opposed the joint South Korean-U.S. military drills, which happen every year and frequently draw the ire of North Korea. Police official Yoon Myeong-seong told reporters that Kim had visited North Korea seven times between 1999 and 2007, and that authorities were investigating a possible connection between his visits to the reclusive state and the attack against Lippert.

In 2010, he received a suspended two-year prison sentence for throwing a piece of concrete at a Japanese ambassador to South Korea, according to the Yonhap news agency.

Four employees of the store have been arrested, but its manager -- herself a woman -- was still at large Saturday, said Goa police superintendent Kartik Kashyap.

After the incident, authorities sealed off the store and summoned six top officials from FabIndia, he said. The arrested staff have been charged with voyeurism and breach of privacy, according to the police. If convicted, they could spend up to three years in jail, Kashyap said.

Last month, the country failed to enforce a law that would allow authorities to arrest people who post offensive material on social media. Others believe the country could learn from events further afield. Some say this method of crowd control needs regulation too. Questions have also been raised as to why the police are resorting to aggression. \"While I think it is bound to fail if not be another scam in the making, it also shows the mindset of the administration to not use dialogue and mediation to solve problems but use authoritarian and forceful methods,\" photojournalist Chirag Wakaskar in Mumbai told CNN. \"What they could do is start by having video surveillance in sensitive areas and have swifter justice.\" Protests are a common occurrence in India, a country with a population of 1.2 billion; Lucknow, the capital of the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, also used drone cameras to monitor crowds at a recent religious festival. As well as being used as a security measure in other cities including Delhi and Mumbai, the unmanned, airborne vehicles have been used in tiger hunts, disaster relief and criminal investigations -- and even pizza deliveries.

Spotters reported a tornado about 6 miles northwest of Goddard, which is less than 15 miles west of Wichita.  That storm moved to the northeast, missing the city, but posing potential risks to other communities. \"There will be storms ... that pop up all night long,\" said CNN severe weather expert Chad Myers. \"Nighttime tornadoes are the most deadly, are the most dangerous.\" Other reports of tornadoes came in from southwestern Kansas, according to the Storm Prediction Center. Three of the sightings were near Aetna, 125 miles southwest of Wichita. Kansas wasn't the only state affected by the storms. The National Weather Service indicated a tornado may have touched down in the small town of Potosi, Missouri, about 70 miles from St. Louis. CNN affiliate KMOV reported that it had received reports of wind damage and flooding in the town. One Instagram user there posted a photo of a fallen tree. Aerial footage also showed damage to roofs and one street overtaken by water.

The shootings were connected, authorities said. They began with what authorities believe was a domestic kidnapping incident, according to D.C. Police Chief Cathy Lanier. The suspect's vehicle was spotted outside the Census Bureau, which is in Suitland, Maryland. A guard apparently approached the vehicle and saw two people arguing. That guard was then shot at least once in the upper body, said Prince George's County Fire Department spokesman Mark Brady. The guard was in extremely critical condition, according to Brady. The police chief said the suspect then fled the scene. Officers picked up the chase, and the suspect fired gunshots at multiple locations, Lanier said. The chase ended in a crash on Washington's busy H Street. A shootout ensues, Lanier said. An officer and the suspect were wounded, according to the police chief. Both were conscious and talking when they left the scene. \"Right now, we have every reason to believe that the car that we have in this last incident here is the same car involved and the same person involved in the kidnapping,\" she said.

More than 200 students signed a petition asking the school not to show the movie as part of UMix, a series of social events the university stages for students. Bradley Cooper was nominated for an Oscar for his portrayal of Chris Kyle, a Navy SEAL and the most lethal sniper in U.S. military history. Kyle was fatally shot at a Texas shooting range in 2013. Some students believed the movie's depiction of the Iraq War reflected negatively on the Middle East and people from that region.

Ramalinga Raju, the former chairman of software services exporter Satyam Computers Services, was also fined $804,000, R.K. Gaur, a spokesman for India's Central Bureau of Investigation, told CNN. In 2009, Satyam Computers Services was at the center of a massive $1.6 billion fraud case after its then-chairman Raju admitted inflating profits with fictitious assets and nonexistent cash. Investigators say losses to investors resulting from the company's book manipulation were much higher. A special court convicted Raju and nine other people of cheating, criminal conspiracy, breach of public trust and other charges, said the Central Bureau of Investigation, which looked into the case. In the media, the case has been compared to the 2001 Enron Corp. scandal, in which a Houston energy company's earnings had been overstated by several hundred million dollars. When the scam made headlines, Satyam, which means \"truth\" in Sanskrit, was India's fourth-largest software services provider. It was serving almost 700 companies, including 185 Fortune 500 companies, and generated more than half of its revenue from the United States. The company had about 53,000 employees and operated in 65 countries. After Raju's shock disclosures six years ago, the Indian government fired Satyam's board. In a subsequent state-backed auction, the company was bought by Tech Mahindra, part of the country's Mahindra Group.

Superior Court Judge Orlando Hudson Jr. ruled that Hicks' case is \"death penalty qualified,\" WRAL and WTVD reported. The 46-year-old was arrested February 10 in the deaths of Yusor Mohammad, 21, her 23-year-old husband, Deah Shaddy Barakat, and 19-year-old sister, Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha. All three were shot in the head. Hicks, who was the victims' neighbor, turned himself in to police the night of the killings. The next week, he was indicted on three counts of first-degree murder and a count of discharging a firearm into an occupied dwelling. He had no prior criminal record, police said. Police said \"an ongoing neighbor dispute over parking\" might have been a factor in the shootings but also said they weren't dismissing the possibility of a hate crime. On what is believed to be Hicks' Facebook page, numerous posts rail against religion. The victims' family members have called on authorities to investigate the slayings as a hate crime.

On Twitter, Brownback, a Republican, said he was proud to sign a law \"protecting life at its most vulnerable stage.\" Planned Parenthood Advocates of Kansas and Mid-Missouri sharply criticized the move, which it described as the latest in a series of \"extreme political measures aimed at denying women access to health care and at undermining their decision-making ability.\" \"Kansas is now not only the sole state with this atrocious law; it also now has more restrictions on abortion than any state in the U.S.,\" the advocacy group said in a Facebook post. Both sides appear to be prepared to take their battle over such measures to other states -- and to court. Carol Tobias, the president of National Right to Life, said in a statement that the Kansas law was the first of what her organization hopes \"will be many state laws.\" \"This law has the power to transform the landscape of abortion policy in the United States,\" she said. Julie Burkhart,  CEO of Wichita-based South Wind Women's Center, said on Twitter that the signing of the law marked a sad day for Kansas and the United States. \"This law puts women at risk and ties doctors' hands,\" she said. \"We'll continue to fight!\" CNN's Sam Stringer contributed to this report.", "claim": "Supporters of the measure describe it as a groundbreaking step .

The victim -- Ron Lane, whom officials said was a longtime employee and the school's print shop operator -- was white, as is the suspect. Lane's relatives said he was gay, CNN affiliate WNCN reported. The suspect, Kenneth Morgan Stancil III, worked with Lane as part of a work-study program, but was let go from the program in early March due to poor attendance, college President Kay Albertson said Tuesday. On Monday, Stancil walked into the print shop on the third floor of a campus building, aimed a pistol-grip shotgun and fired once, killing Lane, according to Sutton. Stancil has tattoos on his face. Sutton said investigators are looking into whether he is part of a white supremacist gang. He has no previous criminal record, authorities said. Sutton said Stancil fled on a motorcycle after the shooting and ultimately abandoned it in a highway median. Then, Stancil continued on to Daytona, Florida, but authorities don't know how he traveled, Sutton said. He was arrested just after 1 a.m. Tuesday, after he was found sleeping on a beach, about 550 miles (885 kilometers) from Goldsboro. Volusia County Beach Patrol had approached him for violating the city's ordinance against sleeping on the beach. He had a knife, police said. He was taken into custody without incident.

His comments to The New York Times, published on Sunday, come amid criticism from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of the deal that the United States and five other world powers struck with Iran. Tehran agreed to halt the country's nuclear ambitions, and in exchange, Western powers would drop sanctions that have hurt the Iran's economy. Obama said he understands and respects Netanyahu's stance that Israel is particularly vulnerable and doesn't \"have the luxury of testing these propositions\" in the deal. \"But what I would say to them is that not only am I absolutely committed to making sure they maintain their qualitative military edge, and that they can deter any potential future attacks, but what I'm willing to do is to make the kinds of commitments that would give everybody in the neighborhood, including Iran, a clarity that if Israel were to be attacked by any state, that we would stand by them,\" Obama said. That, he said, should be \"sufficient to take advantage of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see whether or not we can at least take the nuclear issue off the table,\" he said. The framework negotiators announced last week would see Iran reduce its centrifuges from 19,000 to 5,060, limit the extent to which uranium necessary for nuclear weapons can be enriched and increase inspections. The talks over a final draft are scheduled to continue until June 30. But Netanyahu and Republican critics in Congress have complained that Iran won't have to shut down its nuclear facilities and that the country's leadership isn't trustworthy enough for the inspections to be as valuable as Obama says they are. Obama said even if Iran can't be trusted, there's still a case to be made for the deal. \"In fact, you could argue that if they are implacably opposed to us, all the more reason for us to want to have a deal in which we know what they're doing and that, for a long period of time, we can prevent them from having a nuclear weapon,\" Obama said.", "claim": "Obama says he's \"absolutely committed\" to making sure Israel maintains a military advantage over Iran .

Maricopa County Judge Sherry Stephens could have sentenced Arias to life with the possibility of early release after 25 years, but decided the convicted killer should spend the rest of her life behind bars. Before her sentence was handed down, Arias expressed remorse for her actions. \"To this day I can't believe that I was capable of doing something that terrible,\" Arias said. \"I'm truly disgusted and repulsed with myself. I'm horrified because of what I did, and I wish there was some way I could take it back.\" Earlier, Travis Alexander's sisters gave their victim impact statements.

However, that same jury was unable to reach a unanimous decision on whether she should live or die. A new jury was empanelled in October 2014 to decide Arias' fate, but they, too, were unable to reach a unanimous decision.

A NASA astrophysicist has named an asteroid after the teenage education activist from Pakistan, who was gravely wounded by a Pakistani Taliban gunman for promoting the right of girls' to go to school. It took a meticulous medical response to save her life more than two years ago. But Malala recovered with no serious neurological damage to become a powerhouse for her cause. After reading her story, scientist Amy Mainzer, who also consults for PBS on a children's educational science show, decided Malala deserved to be immortalized. So, she attached her name to the heavens. Thousands of asteroids swarm through the solar system mainly between Mars and Jupiter. Mainzer, working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, discovered Asteroid 316201 in June 2010, which gave her the right to name it. \"My postdoctoral fellow Dr. Carrie Nugent brought to my attention the fact that although many asteroids have been named, very few have been named to honor the contributions of women (and particularly women of color),\" Mainzer wrote in a note to Malala. Mainzer gave it the name 316201 Malala, or 2010 ML48. Malala's asteroid circles the sun between Mars and Jupiter every five and half years, Mainzer said. \"It is about 4 kilometers in diameter, and its surface is very dark, the color of printer toner.\" As a scientist, her support for Malala's work is logical.

The directive comes a few weeks after a Justice Department inspector general report found DEA agents in foreign postings attended sex parties with prostitutes paid for by drug cartels, among other indiscretions.

Michael Barnett captured dramatic video of the fire, on Interstate 30 just northeast of Dallas, and uploaded it to CNN iReport. Smoke and flames poured from the rear of the bus as traffic slowed to a crawl and Barnett slowly approached in his vehicle. As he drew closer to the bus, Barnett decided to stop filming because he didn't know what to expect. \"It was shocking,\" he said. \"I didn't know what I was about to see. I didn't know if anyone was hurt.\" Barnett said he didn't realize at the time that the bus belonged to the country band. Hillary Scott, co-lead singer for the band, posted a photo of the charred bus on Instagram and noted that she, her husband, the tour manager and the driver were all evacuated safely. \"Thanking God for our safety and the safety of all of those who helped put this fire out and keep us safe,\" she wrote. The tour manager told CNN affiliate KTVT that the bus stopped after a rear tire blew out. It burst into flames after everyone had gotten off. Scott also posted an Instagram photo and message saying that the fire destroyed everything in the bus's back lounge except her Bible. The band's two other members, Charles Kelley and Dave Haywood, were not traveling on the bus, KTVT reported.

The bill, which passed 92 to 8, also includes a two-year extension of a popular children's health insurance program. The issue of payments to Medicare providers has been a thorny issue for years.  Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch of Utah called passage of the bill a \"major, major accomplishment.\" \"Tonight, the Senate is voting to retire the outdated, inefficiency-rewarding, common sense-defying Medicare reimbursement system,\" said Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee just before the final vote. The House approved the same bill overwhelmingly more than two weeks ago and President Barack Obama is expected to sign it.  Senate passage came just hours before cuts to physicians would have taken place since the last temporary \"doc fix\" had already expired. Some conservative senators, including Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz of Texas, balked at the more than $200 billion price of the bill and pushed an amendment to have the costs offset. The bill, \"institutionalizes and expands Obamacare policies that harm patients and their doctors while adding roughly half a trillion dollars to our long-term debt within two decades,\" Cruz said in a statement.  \"Any deal should be fully paid for and include significant and structural reforms to Medicare.\" But that amendment was defeated, as were several others from each party that came up for votes. Earlier, House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio warned the Senate not to change the bill. \"Unless the Senate passes the House-passed 'doc fix,' significant cuts to physicians' payments will begin tomorrow,\" Boehner said.  \"We urge the Senate to approve the House-passed bill without delay.\" Cruz voted against the bill, as did Sen.

He said 40 people were injured. Ansar Beit Al-Maqdis, an ISIS affiliate, claimed responsibility for the attack, which came hours after another operation that the group also claimed.

Currently parents can choose to opt out of vaccinations for medical or religious reasons, or by stating they are \"conscientious objectors,\" and still receive taxpayer funded child care benefits. Under the new \"no jab, no pay\" policy, the exemption as a conscientious objector will be removed starting January 2016. \"The choice made by families not to immunize their children is not supported by public policy or medical research nor should such action be supported by taxpayers in the form of child care payments,\" said Abbott in a joint statement with Social Services Minister, Scott Morrison. Thousands of families could lose out on welfare payments, with the Australian government estimating more than 39,000 children under the age of seven have not been vaccinated because of their parents' objections. The number of children in Australia who have not received immunization against measles and other diseases has almost doubled in the past decade, according to the government. Anti-vaccination campaigns have recently gained traction in Western countries. Some parents believe the shots cause autism, but the theory has been widely discredited. Existing exemptions on medical or religious grounds will continue said Abbott, but guidelines on religious exemptions will be tightened. \"It requires the formal position of that religious body being advised to the government and approved by the government. This is a very significant narrowing,\" Morrison told reporters in Sydney on Sunday. He added that no mainstream religious organizations have made any formal objection to immunizations. In response to the announcement, more than 7,000 people have signed a petition in opposition to the reforms.", "claim": "Parents who refuse to vaccinate their children could lose up to $11,000 of welfare benefits a year .

Many of the \"guiding principles\" in the memo mention issues that sunk Clinton's first campaign. The document, according to the source, includes the ideas from Mook, along with a wide array of Clinton's soon-to-be staffers and advisers. The memo maintains that the campaign must remain humble, disciplined and united, something voters in Iowa and others states have said Clinton did not do in 2008. \"This campaign is not about Hillary Clinton and not about us,\" reads the document that was obtained by CNN.

Chancey Allen Luna was found guilty of first-degree murder Friday for his role in the August 2013 drive-by shooting of Christopher Lane, a 23-year-old college student in Duncan, about 80 miles south of Oklahoma City. Luna was 16 at the time of the shooting. Lane, an Australian attending East Central University, was jogging when he was shot in the back by a gun fired by Luna. A jury recommended Friday that Luna spend life in prison without the possibility of parole, according to court records.

Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) deployed the second remote-controlled robot last week after the first one broke down. The robot detected lower radiation levels and temperature than expected, an indicator that cooling systems were working effectively, according to a statement released by TEPCO. \"It is a great step forward towards the decommissioning work as we can earn necessary data for the next investigation,\" said Akira Ono, the chief of Fukushima Daiichi plant. TEPCO said the yellow seen on the images seemed to suggest a discoloration of the grating, though the cause was unknown. It said the green glow could not be seen when filmed from other angles. The shape-shifting robots were sent in to assess the damage in one of the reactors that suffered a meltdown after a devastating earthquake and tsunami in March 2011. TEPCO says the site's still too dangerous for workers to enter. The first robot, which was sent in on April 10, stalled after moving about 10 meters, according to a statement released by TEPCO.  A report and footage from the robot shows that a fallen object had blocked its path and left it stranded. TEPCO decided to cut off the cable connected to the device on April 12 as it had already collected data on radiation levels in 14 of the 18 targeted locations, completing around two-thirds of the originally planned route. The second robot was sent in on April 15 and collected data from all 11 points, as scheduled. Four years after the devastating nuclear crisis, the radiation levels inside the three damaged reactors are still extremely high and remain unsafe for people to enter.

For starters, as a new trailer shows, Sue and Johnny Storm's father initiates the project that ends up giving the foursome their powers. They also end up in another dimension, and we see the early flirtation between Sue Storm and Reed Richards as well. The movie, due out August 7, promises a very different take on the classic Marvel comics characters, played this go-round by Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B. Jordan and Jamie Bell. We also get our first glimpse of the villainous Dr. Doom in this new trailer, released Sunday. Fans on Twitter had mixed reactions. Check out the trailer here: . The trailerpalooza of \"Star Wars,\" \"Batman v. Superman\" and \"Fantastic Four\" kept sci-fi and superhero fans chattering all weekend.

After a genetically modified mutant dinosaur escapes from an island theme park along with others, he takes charge of a mission to contain the dangerous creatures. (The trailer also includes part of a scene that caused controversy after Joss Whedon called it \"sexist\" last week.) The movie is first in the rampaging-dino franchise since \"Jurassic Park III\" in 2001. And, as we see for the first time, the dinosaurs have learned to communicate with each other. Uh-oh.

{"id": 123, "text": "(CNN)A fiery sunset greeted people in Washington Sunday. The deep reddish color caught Seattle native Tim Durkan's eye. He photographed a handful of aerial shots of the sunset warming the city's skyline and shared them on CNN iReport. The stunning sunsets were the result of raging wildfires in parts of Siberia. \"The dramatic sunsets began showing up over the weekend and had Seattle locals wondering where the amber-colored haze was originating from,\" Durken said. The fires were started in southeastern Siberia, by farmers burning grass in their fields. But on April 14, it is believed that the flames quickly grew out of control because of strong winds and spread throughout the region, according to CNN affiliate KOMO-TV. As a result, the fires have destroyed dozens of villages in the region. Rescue crews were able to put out the flames. However, the lingering smoke from the widespread fires were picked up by atmospheric winds. The winds carried the smoke from Siberia across the Pacific Ocean and brought it to the Pacific Northwest. Parts of Oregon, Washington and British Columbia are seeing the results of the smoke, wind and solar light combination. The reason people are seeing an intense red sunset is a result of smoke particles filtering out the shorter wavelength colors from the sunlight like greens, blues, yellows and purples, KOMO-TV said. That means colors like red and orange are able to penetrate the air unfiltered. The colors are especially intense during sunrises and sunsets because there is more atmosphere for the light to travel through to get to a person's eye. As the smoke starts to dissipate, air quality will get better and these fiery sunsets will lose their reddish hue.", "claim": "The fiery sunsets are the result of raging wildfires in parts of Siberia .

His feat of swift consumption in a crowded bar impressed some people but annoyed others. And observers were quick to point out that Abbott had previously criticized binge drinking in Australia. Abbott was in a Sydney pub on Saturday evening when a group of Australian rules football players invited him to have a drink with them. The Prime Minister accepted and even gave a short, impromptu speech, one of the football coaches, Simon Carrodus, told The Australian Woman's Weekly. \"Then he proceeds to reach down and grab a schooner and he drank from head-to-toe the entire schooner, dribbling little bits on his shirt ... tipped it upside down on his head. And he was proud as punch,\" Carrodus said. A schooner holds about three-quarters of a pint. Video of Abbott making short work of the beer as the crowd around him chants \"Skol! Skol!\" drew plenty of attention on social media. Some commentators focused on Abbott's drinking technique. But others suggested he was setting a bad example. Abbott had attacked binge drinking as recently as last year. \"Like most Australians, I enjoy a drink on social occasions,\" he said in January 2014. \"However, as a father and as a citizen, I'm appalled by the violent binge drinking culture that now seems so prevalent, especially at \"hot spots\" in our big cities.\" Casting those concerns aside, some social media users belittled Abbott's beer swilling.

Dozens of attackers took control of government buildings, including the city's Central Prison, Central Bank and radio station during the assault early Thursday, according to officials. Government troops arrived early Thursday and clashed with the al Qaeda fighters, and most of the militants fled, the officials said. Last month, hundreds of inmates escaped from Al Mansoorah Central Prison in Aden after clashes between Shiite Houthi rebels and forces loyal to ousted Sunni President  Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi. Yemen has been descending into chaos in the weeks since Shiite Houthi rebels removed Hadi, a Sunni, from power. The sectarian nature of the conflict is drawing in regional rivals Saudi Arabia, which is predominately Sunni -- and is the country to which Hadi ultimately fled -- and Iran, which is predominately Shiite and supports the Houthi rebels. Because of that, the conflict in Yemen risks becoming a proxy war in the struggle between the Iranians and the Saudis for preeminence in the Middle East. The Saudis have conducted airstrikes against the Houthi rebels and could send in ground troops. But little is simple in the Middle East. And while the conflict between the Houthis and forces loyal to Hadi rages in the western part of the country, where it has caused hundreds of civilian deaths, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, controls parts of eastern Yemen.

The whale, named Varvara, swam nearly 14,000 miles (22,500 kilometers), according to a release from Oregon State University, whose scientists helped conduct the whale-tracking study. Varvara, which is Russian for \"Barbara,\" left her primary feeding ground off Russia's Sakhalin Island to cross the  Pacific Ocean and down the West Coast of the United States to Baja, Mexico. Varvara's journey surpassed a record listed on the Guinness Worlds Records website. It said the previous record was set by a humpback whale that swam a mere 10,190-mile round trip between the \"warm breeding waters near the equator and the colder food-rich waters of the Arctic and Antarctic regions.\" Records are nice, but Bruce Mate, the lead author of the study, thinks the long trip might say more about the whale than just its ability to swim. During her 14,000-mile journey, Varvara visited \"three major breeding areas for eastern gray whales,\" which was a surprise to Mate, who is also the director of the Marine Mammal Institute at Oregon State University. \"For her to go to Mexico,\" Mate said, \"It's pretty strong evidence that it's where she's from.\" Varvara was thought to be an endangered western whale, but her ability to \"navigate across open water over tremendously long distances is impressive,\" he said in the release, which could mean that some western gray whales are actually eastern grays. With only 150 western gray whales believed to be in existence, that number might be even lower. \"Past studies have indicated genetic differentiation between the species, but this suggests we may need to take a closer look,\" Mate said.

That's a pretty healthy profit for the collector who bought the outfit decades ago for a mere $20 as it was on the verge of being tossed out. The outfit, a gray two-piece ensemble, was sold at an auction in Beverly Hills, California, on Saturday, according to Heritage Auctions. It was the most sought after item among roughly 150 pieces of \"Gone With the Wind\" memorabilia on sale in the auction. They come from the huge collection amassed by James Tumblin, who used to work at Universal Studios. Tumblin said he came across the Scarlett O'Hara dress in the early 1960s while doing some research at a costume company. \"I saw this dress on the floor and a docent told me not to bother to pick it up, because they were throwing it away,\" he said, according to The Telegraph. \"I asked if he would sell it to me,\" he said. \"I had noticed there was a printed label saying Selznick International Pictures and 'Scarlett production dress' was written in ink.\" From that savvy purchase, his \"Gone With the Wind\" collection snowballed. Other standout items include a straw hat worn by Leigh in a number of scenes in the movie and a gray wool suit worn by Clark Gable as his character, Rhett Butler, kicks down the door of Scarlett O'Hara's boudoir. The dress -- a jacket and full skirt ensemble -- was worn in several key scenes in the 1939 movie, including when Scarlett O'Hara encounters Butler and when she gets attacked in the shanty town. The outfit has suffered a little with age, however. When Leigh wore it in the movie, it was slate blue-gray. Over the years, it's faded to light gray.

Federal police arrested Joao Vaccari Neto at his home in Sao Paulo on Wednesday morning. Vaccari faces charges of corruption and money laundering as part of the broader probe into corruption at Petrobras. Former executives who have turned state's evidence claim that construction companies paid large sums under the table to Petrobras officials and politicians in order to secure lucrative contracts with the oil giant. Vaccari has denied any wrongdoing and recently told a congressional commission that all donations to his party were legal and were reviewed by electoral authorities. Vaccari is the closest political figure to Rousseff so far implicated in the investigation. Rousseff herself has not been implicated, although she was the chairwoman of Petrobras when much of the alleged corruption took place. Rousseff has insisted she supports the probe and has not in any way interfered with the investigation. Sources quoted in Brazilian media have said investigators are looking at whether some of the bribes went toward Rousseff's election campaigns. Anger over what has ballooned into a multi-million dollar corruption scandal has eroded Rousseff's approval rating and prompted hundreds of thousands of Brazilians to take to the streets in protest.

{"id": 162, "text": "(CNN)It's been a busy few weeks for multiples. The first set of female quintuplets in the world since 1969 was born in Houston on April 8, and the parents are blogging about their unique experience. Danielle Busby delivered all five girls at the Woman's Hospital of Texas via C-section at 28 weeks and two days, according to CNN affiliate KPRC. Parents Danielle and Adam and big sister Blayke are now a family of eight. The babies are named Ava Lane, Hazel Grace, Olivia Marie, Parker Kate and Riley Paige. \"We are so thankful and blessed,\" said Danielle Busby, who had intrauterine insemination to get pregnant. \"I honestly give all the credit to my God. I am so thankful for this wonderful hospital and team of people here. They truly all are amazing.\" You can learn all about their journey at their blog, \"It's a Buzz World.\" Early news reports said the Busby girls were the first all-female quintuplets born in the U.S. But a user alerted CNN to news clippings that show quintuplet girls were born in 1959 to Charles and Cecilia Hannan in San Antonio. All of the girls died within 24 hours. Like the Busby family, Sharon and Korey Rademacher were hoping for a second child. When they found out what they were having, they decided to keep it a secret from family and friends. That's why they didn't tell their family the gender of baby No. 2 -- or that Sharon was actually expecting not one but two girls, according to CNN affiliate WEAR. And when everyone arrived at West Florida Hospital in Pensacola, Florida, after Sharon gave birth March 11, they recorded everyone's reactions to meeting twins Mary Ann Grace and Brianna Faith. The video was uploaded to YouTube on Saturday and has been viewed more than 700,000 times.

From Friday to Monday, a total of 8,480 migrants were rescued, according to the Italian coast guard, which said it received on Monday -- alone -- SOS calls from 20 boats in distress. On Tuesday, a spokesman with Save the Children told CNN the group fears 400 migrants could be missing, citing testimony from survivors who said their ship carrying 550 people capsized in the Mediterranean Sea about 80 miles off the Libyan coast. The Italian coast guard, however, told CNN that while it is taking the report seriously, it cannot confirm such an incident and has not yet found evidence at sea to indicate a migrant boat carrying approximately 550 has capsized with 145 rescued. An operation that included boats and planes did not find any survivors, nor bodies, nor any evidence to indicate a particular boat capsized, Coast Guard official Filippo Marini said. There has been a recent upsurge in migrant boats crossing the Mediterranean into Italy and an increase in rescues performed by the Italian Coast Guard to aid migrant boats. Why migrants are dying trying to reach Italy . According to the International Organization for Migration, Italy registered more than 10,000 migrants arriving in the first three months of 2015, and about 2,000 were rescued at sea during the first weekend of April in the Channel of Sicily. Most migrants recorded this year come from countries in West Africa as well as Somalia and Syria, the IOM said. They use Libya as a country of transit. At least 480 migrants have died while crossing the Mediterranean since the beginning of the year, often because of bad weather and overcrowded vessels used by smugglers, the IOM said.

It was a call to action: Within hours of the first 7.8 magnitude quake, India began planning a massive cross-border aid mission. With each hour, the scale of the devastation in Nepal became clearer -- some 3,862 people are known to have died so far -- and plans in India, where 72 people were also killed, got bigger. On Sunday alone, India delivered 187 tons of supplies, including 50 tons of water, 22 tons of food and 2 tons of medicine. And there will be more to come. Hundreds of trained disaster relief troops landed in Kathmandu and quickly got to work. With each flight in, there was a flight back out, packed with Indians and other nationals escaping to safety: 2,000 and counting have fled so far. By Monday, India was in full-scale crisis mode: From airports across India, planes flew in loaded with aid, and trucks made the trip by land from India's east, aiming for more remote areas. On the ground: Devastation in Nepal . India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made a special effort over Nepal. He has visited the country twice in his first year in office. And on Sunday, in his national radio address to the nation, he said Indians needed to \"wipe the tears of every Nepali, hold their hands, and stand with them.\" It all highlights the more proactive role taken by India in recent months. Just weeks ago, India flexed its military muscle to rescue Indians and other nationals from conflict-torn Yemen. Now, it is taking the lead in Nepal. Some might say India's friendship is a signal for the other big country that shares a border with Nepal: China. A display of hard power, perhaps to achieve enduring soft power in the region. But in times like this, help is always welcome. First there's the immediate search and rescue operation, and then the long process of rebuilding work. Nepal will need India's friendship -- as well as China's -- for many long months ahead.", "claim": "India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made a special effort over Nepal .

Mitchell, who was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997, was taken to UCLA Medical Center a month ago after being found unconscious in her home. She remains at the hospital, according to Leslie Morris' court petition filed April 28. Morris is described as Mitchell's friend of more than 44 years in the legal documents. Whether the folk and jazz singer is conscious remains a matter of some confusion. In her April 28 petition, Morris says Mitchell is unconscious: \"At this time she (Mitchell) remains unconscious and unable to make any responses, and is therefore unable to provide for any of her personal needs.\" But on Mitchell's website, a statement posted the same day that says it was approved by Morris says Mitchell is alert. \"Contrary to rumors circulating on the Internet today, Joni is not in a coma. Joni is still in the hospital -- but she comprehends, she's alert, and she has her full senses. A full recovery is expected. The document obtained by a certain media outlet simply gives her longtime friend Leslie Morris the authority -- in the absence of 24-hour doctor care -- to make care decisions for Joni once she leaves the hospital.\" When asked about the discrepancy between statements about Mitchell's health on her website and in the legal filing, her publicist, Alisse Kingsley, responded that \"the website\" was accurate. A doctor's capacity declaration stated that Mitchell will likely be unable, due to her medical condition, to attend any court hearings for the next four to six months.

{"id": 215, "text": "(CNN)Japan's space agency announced this week that the country would put an unmanned rover on the surface of the moon by 2018, joining an elite club of nations who have explored Earth's satellite. The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), divulged the plan to an expert panel, including members of the cabinet and the Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology Ministry on Monday. \"This is an initial step and a lot of procedures are still ahead before the plan is formally approved,\" a JAXA spokesperson told reporters. If it is approved, the agency will reportedly use its Epsilon solid-fuel rocket technology to carry and deploy a SLIM probe -- the acronym stands for \"Smart Lander for Investigating Moon\" -- on the surface of the celestial body. Japanese media estimates that the mission will cost in the region of \u00a510 billion to \u00a515 billion ($83.4 million - $125 million). JAXA spokesperson Chihito Onda confirmed to CNN that this estimate is realistic. The mission is expected to be used to perfect soft-landing technologies, which could be utilized in future, manned expeditions to the moon, or even Mars. The lander will use face recognition software found in digital cameras, which will be repurposed to enable the craft to recognize craters on the surface, Onda said. The move could be seen as Japan's attempt to play catchup to its Asian neighbors China and India, which have both notched significant extraterrestrial victories in recent years -- China's Yutu lunar rover outlasted expectations and India successfully put a probe into orbit around Mars the first time of asking. In 2008 Japan put its SELENE craft -- known in Japan as Kaguya, after a Japanese moon princess from a 10th century folk tale -- into orbit around the moon to gather data about its surface. The data gathered by the orbiter will also be used to calculate a suitable landing site for the rover. JAXA has also put a probe on an asteroid, which returned to Earth in 2010. Along with China, the United States and the former Soviet Union are the only other nations to have so far landed craft on the surface of the moon.

{"id": 222, "text": "Tripoli, Libya (CNN)Smugglers lure Arab and African migrants by offering discounts to get onto overcrowded ships if people bring more potential passengers, a CNN investigation has revealed. A smuggler in the Libyan capital of Tripoli laid bare the system for loading boats with poor and desperate refugees, during a conversation that a CNN producer secretly filmed. The conversation, recorded using a mobile phone, exposes the prices and incentives used to gather as many migrants as possible onto ships. An estimated 1,600 migrants have died so far this year on the dangerous Mediterranean crossing, but still more wait to try to reach Europe. CNN's producer was introduced to a Senegalese and Malian smuggler by an intermediary in Tripoli, who mistakenly thought she was a Syrian looking to bring other Syrian refugees with her onto boats to Italy. Why I fled: Migrants share their stories . The smuggler took her to an unfinished building on the outskirts of Tripoli near the city's many ports, where the migrants they have already found are kept until the crossing is ready. The building could only be reached by walking down a trash-littered alleyway, and featured a series of packed rooms, separated by curtains, where dozens sat -- well over the 80 migrants she was promised would be in her boat. The smuggler explained that the \"final price\" for Syrians -- often thought to be richer than their African migrant counterparts -- was $1,000. He added that for each Syrian she brought with her, the producer would get a $100 discount. So if she brought 10, she could travel free. He explained how the \"discount\" was \"well known,\" suggesting perhaps it was part of the unwritten rules that govern the trade and why so many migrants come to each boat. Any fears about the crossing were supposed to be allayed by the smuggler insisting the boats they used had new motors, and that the Senegalese pilot would have a satellite telephone and GPS to assist the crossing. He also assured CNN's producer, when asked, that if the people became too many, they would use two boats.

Andrew Cuomo said Friday that more than 160 patients in nine days have been rushed to hospitals across the state for adverse reactions to synthetic cannabinoid, known as \"spice\" or \"K2.\" \"Spice\" and other similar synthetic drugs are often marketed as legal plant material coated with chemicals that are supposed to mimic the effects of marijuana, according to a statement from the governor's office. \"Since the exact compounds contained in synthetic cannabinoid products change so frequently, it's often impossible for users to know exactly what they are putting in their body,\" acting New York State Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker said. Symptoms after use have a wide range of severity, from confusion, drowsiness and headaches to increased heart rate, seizures and loss of consciousness, according to the New York State Department of Health. Synthetic marijuana is popular among teens because it is marketed as incense or natural products to \"mask its true purpose,\" the health department statement said. \"Young people may be fooled into thinking that these substances are safe because they are sold over the counter or are in colorful packaging, but they are not made for human consumption,\" New York Alcohol and Substance Abuse Service s Commissioner Arlene Gonzalez Sanchez said. \"They are dangerous and can have significant, long-term effects on the brain.\" The recent surge is not isolated in New York; other states across the country have noticed similar trends.

If the searchers haven't found anything by the time they've covered the entire 60,000-square-kilometer priority zone, the search will stretch into a new equally vast area, government officials from Malaysia, Australia and China announced Thursday. \"Ministers remain committed to bring closure and some peace to the families and loved ones of those on board Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370,\" the three countries said in a joint statement. The search of the current priority zone is expected to be completed in May. Covering the new zone could take as long as a year. At that point, \"all high probability search areas would have been covered,\" the governments said Thursday. The size of the doubled search area, the equivalent of more than 46,000 square miles, would be bigger than the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. Flight 370 vanished after taking off from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on March 8, 2014, bound for Beijing. Officials are still trying to figure out why it veered dramatically off course over the sea between Malaysia and Vietnam and where exactly it ended up. An international team of experts used satellite data to calculate that the plane eventually went down in the southern Indian Ocean, far off the coast of Western Australia.

(they're) about the need to constrain our development,\" not just about Ukraine and Crimea. Western sanctions were implemented after Moscow annexed Crimea and pro-Russian separatists battled Ukrainian government forces in the nation's east. Putin predicted the sanctions would not end soon. On the Middle East, the Russian leader defended lifting a ban on the sale of a sophisticated air defense system to Iran. \"We need to encourage our Iranian partners,\" Putin said, referring to a preliminary deal to limit Iran's nuclear program. Sanctions against Iran have had a dramatic impact on the nation's economy. On Israeli and Western fears that such a system would embolden Iran, Putin scoffed. \"Iran is not a threat to Israel at all,\" he said. \"It is a defense weapon.\" Putin's annual exercise is fascinating for ordinary Russians, who normally get him in closely managed doses on state-run television. These sessions are live and can go on and on. Last year, he spoke for three hours and 55 minutes. In 2013, it was a record-setting four hours and 47 minutes. Organizers said public interest was especially strong this year, with 2.4 million questions submitted. Of course, critics of the Kremlin slam the entire event as Russia's imitation of democracy in action. It's hard to imagine a truly critical question, they say, getting aired on national television there. In fact, it's best not to look at this event as an opportunity for Russians to question their leader at all. Instead, it is more like a highly produced, highly choreographed chance for their leader to speak to them, and to the world. Last year, there was a \"surprise\" appearance by NSA whistle-blower Edward Snowden, who was granted asylum in Russia. He addressed Putin by video link, quizzing Putin about Moscow's own surveillance practices.", "claim": "Vladimir Putin shrugged off repeated questions about the impact of Western sanctions on his nation .

The system has been developed by DARPA's Extreme Accuracy Tasked Ordnance program, known as EXACTO. \"True to DARPA's mission, EXACTO has demonstrated what was once thought impossible: the continuous guidance of a small-caliber bullet to target,\" said Jerome Dunn, DARPA program manager. \"This live-fire demonstration from a standard rifle showed that EXACTO is able to hit moving and evading targets with extreme accuracy at sniper ranges unachievable with traditional rounds. Fitting EXACTO's guidance capabilities into a small .50-caliber size is a major breakthrough and opens the door to what could be possible in future guided projectiles across all calibers,\" Dunn said. Videos supplied by DARPA show the bullets making sharp turns in midair as they pursue their targets. It all conjures up images of a cartoon character frantically fleeing a bullet that follows him wherever he goes. Only, these bullets are traveling at hundreds of miles per hour. And even the Road Runner can't run that fast. DARPA says the smart bullets will also help shooters who are trying, for example, to hit targets in high winds. The goals of the EXACTO program are giving shooters accuracy at greater distances, engaging targets sooner and enhancing the safety of American  troops, DARPA said.", "claim": "The U.S. military says it has made great progress in its effort to develop a self-steering bullet .

The discovery came on the same day a Japanese court approved a government plan to restart two reactors at the Sendai nuclear power plant in Kagoshima prefecture, more than four years after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's push to restart the reactors is unpopular among many Japanese, who view nuclear energy as too dangerous. A staff member spotted the drone Wednesday morning on the roof of Abe's residence, Tokyo Metropolitan Police said. Dozens of police investigators were dispatched to the roof to investigate the origin of the drone, which had four propeller and was 50 centimeters (20 inches) wide. Police say the drone was equipped with a small camera, smoke flares and a plastic bottle containing small traces of a radioactive material believed to be cesium, a common byproduct of nuclear reactors. Cesium was also discovered in areas around the failed Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant after its 2011 meltdown. Investigators suspect the cesium was placed in the bottle. The amount inside is not immediately harmful to humans.

The shipwreck was swift, with the trawler going down in the Sea of Okhotsk within 15 minutes of getting into difficulties, the news agency reported. The most likely cause of the shipwreck was collision with an obstacle which damaged the hull, the official spokesman of Russia's Investigative Committee, Vladimir Markin, is quoted as saying. The trawler is also thought to have keeled over as a result of hauling some 80 tons of fish on to the deck, the chairman of the emergencies commission in the Kamchatka region, Sergey Khabarov, told Tass.", "claim": "More than 60 people were rescued from the chilly waters in Russia's Far East .

The moon slipped fully into Earth's shadow at 4:58 a.m. Pacific Time (7:58 a.m. ET) Saturday, starting a total lunar eclipse for nearly five minutes -- what NASA says will be the shortest such eclipse of the century. The celestial body took on a burnt-orange tint in the minutes before, during and after the total eclipse, giving the moon the appearance that earns total eclipses the \"blood moon\" nickname. Watchers in the eastern half of North America caught only a partial eclipse -- and in some places, an orange one -- before the moon set below the horizon. The event started at 3:16 a.m. PT (6:16 a.m. ET), when the moon began moving into Earth's shadow. \"The lunar eclipse is looking good!\" tweeted Ryan Hoke, a meteorologist for CNN affiliate WAVE in Louisville, Kentucky, showing a picture of a reddish partial moon in a blue dawn sky. People from the U.S. West Coast to Australia were able to catch the total eclipse. Parts of South America, India, China and Russia were able to see at least parts of the event, but it wasn't visible in Greenland, Iceland, Europe, Africa or the Middle East. A lunar eclipse happens when the sun, Earth and moon form a straight line in space, with the Earth smack in the middle. The sun shines on the Earth and creates a shadow. As the moon moves deeper into that shadow, it appears to turn dark and may even appear to be a reddish color.  Why red? Because Earth's atmosphere is filtering out most of the blue light. NASA says lunar eclipses typically happen at least twice a year, but this eclipse is the third in a series of four in a row, known as a \"tetrad.\"  The first was April 15, 2014, and the second was October 23, 2014. The space agency predicts the next one will come September 28. Did you see it?

Yemen-based Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, in a news release and wanted poster distributed online, offers the reward for the death or capture of Houthi leader Abdelmalik Bedrudin Al-Houthi and former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh. Converted to currency, the gold reward would be worth about $774,000. AQAP referred to Al-Houthi and Saleh as the \"two heads of evil.\" AQAP is one of several factions fighting to control Yemen. With Sunni Islamic roots, AQAP is a bitter enemy of the Houthi faction, which is Shia and widely believed to be supported by Iran. Yemen has been descending into chaos in the weeks since Houthi rebels -- minority Shiites who have long complained of being marginalized in the majority Sunni country -- forced Yemeni President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi from power in January. The Houthis, allied with fighters loyal to Saleh, have since faced resistance from not only AQAP, but also a number of groups including forces loyal to Hadi. Also opposing the Houthis are Saudi Arabia and other predominantly Sunni nations, which last month began airstrikes against the rebels. At least 540 people -- including 311 civilians -- have died as a result of the fighting, the United Nations said Wednesday.

Much of this month's violence happened in the port city of Durban, where at least two foreigners and three South Africans were killed after mobs with machetes attacked immigrant shops. Thousands of people took temporary shelter at refugee centers or police stations as a result, according to aid group Gift of the Givers. Similar violence happened late last week in Johannesburg, where immigrant-owned shops were looted or destroyed. The attacks came as residents accused immigrants of taking their jobs and committing crimes. The unemployment rate in South Africa is 25%, according to government figures.

Three of the militants were killed by Iranian forces in the fighting Monday in the southeastern town of Negur, the state-run news agency IRNA reported. The news agency cited Ali Asghar Mirshekari, the deputy governor of Iran's Sistan-Baluchestan province, who said the militants crossed into the country from Pakistan. Iranian officials have reportedly asked Pakistani authorities to catch the surviving assailants. A militant group called Jaish al Adal claimed responsibility for the attack, according to Iranian state media and a Twitter account believed to be associated with the organization. According to Pakistani media, Jaish al Adal is an anti-Iranian group that has emerged during recent years in areas of Balochistan, the restive Pakistani province that borders southeastern Iran. The Sunni Muslim group has targeted Shiites and says it aims to thwart Iranian influence in Pakistan, according to the Pakistani newspaper Dawn. Jaish al Adal has also claimed responsibility for attacks on Iranian territory. One of the deadliest was in October 2013, when 14 Iranian border guards were killed near the city of Saravan. Iranian authorities say that after similar attacks, the militants have fled back into Balochistan. \"Iran has repeatedly criticized its eastern neighbor for failing to rein in the terrorists,\" IRNA said, referring to Pakistan. The Pakistani government condemned Monday's attack, calling it an \"act of terrorism.\" \"The concerned security agencies of Pakistan are actively investigating this incident, which took place on Iran's territory, and have asked Iranian authorities to share with us any evidence that they have,\" the government said in a statement Wednesday.

Details of the plot for 2016's \"Star Wars: Rogue One\" were revealed during a panel at Star Wars Celebration fan festival Sunday in Anaheim, California. Director Gareth Edwards (\"Godzilla\") showed an early teaser for the movie and revealed plot details for the \"Star Wars\" anthology film (the term Disney prefers instead of \"spinoff\"), starring Felicity Jones. The movie will take place in between \"Episode III: Revenge of the Sith\" and \"Episode IV: A New Hope\" (known to many as the first \"Star Wars\" movie from 1977). A group of rebels go on a rogue mission to steal plans for the Death Star. Jones will play a rebel soldier. The movie won't begin shooting until this summer so the footage shown in the teaser -- including a glimpse of the Death Star -- won't necessarily appear in the finished product. Edwards told the crowd that Jones is a \"Star Wars\" fan and dropped everything to take on the lead role. Producer Kathleen Kennedy said \"Rogue One\" was one of the first pitches she received after becoming president of Lucasfilm in 2012, and she could not turn it down. It was one of the final events at Celebration, where fans gather to talk about \"Star Wars,\" dress in costumes, look for rare \"Star Wars\" merchandise and learn about future projects for the franchise. The convention kicked off with the well-received trailer for this year's \"The Force Awakens.\" Costumes and props from that movie also were on display.

It is understood a group of eight contracted workers broke into the 52-metre slide after it was closed earlier in the night due to fears the heavy rain would make the slide particularly slippery. Scroll down for video . Five staff members left the Royal Easter Show with serious injuries after taking a joy ride on the closed Super Slide . The Easter Show's chief operating officer Michael Collins told Fairfax the slide 'runs way too fast in the wet' and that's why it was closed as soon as the weather turned. It is reported the group were travelling at such great speeds that they were unable to stop and broke through the barricade at the bottom of the ride. A 22-year-old woman broke both her legs, a 60-year-old man suffered broken ribs and internal bleeding while a 23-year-old woman also broke her leg and a 33-year-old man possibly broke his arm. Three of the contractors escaped without injury. Officials closed the ride earlier that night after deciding heavy rain made the ride particularly dangerous . The 22-year old woman and the 60-year-old man required emergency medical treatment and were taken to Westmead Hospital, while the others sought treatment at Concord Hospital. The slide underwent a safety check Sunday morning and was cleared for use, as long as there wasn't another downpour. The thrill seekers were travelling at such great speeds they were unable to stop eventually running into a barricade at the bottom of the slide . Mr Collins said although he hopes the employees have a quick recovery, it was their disregard for safety instructions that got themselves into this situation. 'I want to reinforce the message that you should be abiding by directions, if the train station is closed, you don't climb over onto railway tracks, It is a shame that people have taken it upon themselves to do so on this occasion.'", "claim": "Five staff members sustained serious injuries after taking a joy ride down 'the Super Slide' at the Sydney Royal Easter Show .

The striker's significantly more modest form since then, however, coupled with the meteoric rise of homegrown star Harry Kane, have left Adebayor little more than a bit-part in the Spurs machine. This season, he has made just 16 appearances in all competitions, scoring only twice and has been criticised for several underwhelming performances, in particular his showing against League One's Sheffield United in the Capital One Cup semi-final. Yet, the former Arsenal, Real Madrid and Manchester City hitman remains adamant that he will see out the remainder of his contract in north London. Adebayor's last Premier League goal for Spurs came during a 1-2 defeat by Newcastle back in October last year. Adebayor has made just 10 appearances in all competitions this season and scored only twice .

Maverick Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor performs a strange dance in front of the Arc de Triomphe .

Since then, however, Adebayor's goal return has become significantly more modest and he has not scored in the league for Spurs since the 2-1 defeat to Newcastle back in October. Factor in the remarkable rise of academy graduate Harry Kane and it is easy to see why some sections of supporters have written Adebayor off as surplus to requirements.

The away contingent are currently crammed into a corner of the ground between the South Stand and the East Stand. Manager Eddie Howe prefers the away fans not to be behind one of the goals to give his players a psychological advantage when they are playing in front of a home crowd. Bournemouth will not look to increase the capacity of their 12,000-seater\u00a0Goldsands Stadium . Premier League rules state clubs must give the away fans 10 per cent of their overall allocation . Bournemouth officials are considering doubling the South Stand from its current 2,500 seats to 5,000, taking the whole capacity to just less than 15,000. However, Premier League regulations state that clubs must provide at least 10 per cent of their overall allocation of tickets for away supporters. This would mean that, should Bournemouth press ahead with the expansion, away fans might then have to be positioned behind one of the goals - against Howe\u2019s wishes. Last year, the possibility of increasing the stadium to 18,000 by filling in all four corners was discussed, but the logistics of that make it unlikely. Just to expand the South Stand would cost the club \u00a31.8million and, over the course of a season, they would only accrue \u00a3900,000 in ticket sales. Any construction would, therefore, be for the benefit of fans as opposed to any financial advantage. Manager Eddie Howe is reluctant to change the position of the away fans to behind the goal . With a capacity of 12,000 Bournemouth look set to have the smallest ground in the Premier League . The club will have to install undersoil heating during the summer to adhere to Premier League rules, something which was not a requirement in the Championship. The press box, which at present separates home and away fans in the East Stand, will also move to the opposite side of the pitch to be closer to the dugouts. Stewards or netting would be put between supporters from either side to keep them apart during matches. Bournemouth only had the South Stand built when they won promotion to the Championship in 2013, such has been their rapid rise up the football pyramid.", "claim": "Bournemouth are set to hold off on expanding the capacity of their Goldsands Stadium .

Sorry, but it\u2019s true. With a few exceptions, you don\u2019t get the better opportunities. You get the football version of mopping up the toilets. Chris Ramsey, the only black manager in the Premier League, is a classic example. Ramsey is a fine coach who has been overlooked for countless jobs. Chris Ramsey (right) and Kevin Hitchcock watch QPR hammer West Brom to keep their survival hopes alive . Ramsey takes nots during his side's biggest win of the season which gave their survival chances a boost . He took the QPR position after Harry Redknapp, a talented, experienced manager with a good track record of rescuing clubs in trouble, saw the writing on the wall and got out. Ramsey was asked to board the sinking ship and, guess what, it has not been an easy job to refloat it. Before the victory at West Brom, QPR were sliding deeper into trouble and there were already those seeking to blame it on Ramsey. Just as predictably, there were also those saying Ramsey\u2019s struggles were an indication black managers tend to fail on the rare occasions they are given a chance. John Barnes' troubled reign at Celtic ended after an infamous Scottish Cup defeat by Inverness Caley Thistle . If Ramsey is sacked, people will say it was about results, not race. And they will be wrong. Because race was why he had to take the job in the first place. People tend not to like inconvenient truths about why there are so few black managers in the English game. Some got angry again when John Barnes suggested a manager on a bad run will get sacked sooner if he\u2019s black. He was right. The fact Ramsey has been labouring to turn things around at QPR does not mean he is not a good manager. It just means that when your only chance in the game is to accept a hospital pass, the odds are you\u2019re going to get hurt.", "claim": "Chris Ramsey is the only black manager in the Premier League .

Oliver was more decisive when Cesc Fabregas went to ground after feeling contact from Santi Cazorla. The fall was exaggerated and theatrical and that might have influenced Oliver as he cautioned the Spaniard for simulation. Chelsea should have had a penalty when Brazilian forward Oscar nicked the ball past David Ospina . The Arsenal goalkeeper clattered Oscar, who was left with a possible concussion and replaced at half time . Replays proved that to be incorrect as they showed slight contact on Fabregas' knee - perhaps not enough for a penalty but certainly enough contact to make the caution incorrect. Arsenal had an appeal of their own when the ball span up and caught Gary Cahill on the arm but again I thought Oliver was right as Cahill was very close to the Arsenal player and his arm was not in an unnatural position. There was only one clear penalty for me when Oscar was played clean through on goal and lobbed David Ospina the Arsenal keeper clearly wiped Oscar out and Oliver should have given them a penalty. Oliver may well have been waiting to see if Oscar's lob went in the goal but once it was cleared he should have gone back, awards the penalty and cautioned Ospina.

An Army spokeswoman said they will go into effect in the 'very near future.' The changes came as a result of feedback from soldiers. But it wasn't so long ago that the Army made a much different announcement concerning its tattoo policy.

Under those regulations, any soldier with tattoos was barred from seeking a\u00a0promotion to warrant officer or commissioning as an officer. Tattoos have long been a part of military culture, but as they have become more popular, and more prominently displayed on the body, the various branches have been regulating them in to try to maintain a professional look.

The Dutch owner of the 2012 supercar was waiting in the Hotel Exedra after attending a meeting of the Ferrari Owner's Club with his wife in Anzio, south of Rome. The car's owner entrusted the car, which is one of the most powerful ever produced by Ferrari, to a parking attendant who attempted to return it to the hotel in a timely manner.

However, instead of pressing the brake when approaching a shop front, the driver mashed the throttle, unleashing 671bhp from the magnificent 6.0-litre V12 engine, which ordinarily could propel the car to 60 miles per hour in less than 3.5 seconds. The Corriere della Sera\u00a0said that the driver, Roberto Cinti, 38, told police following the accident: 'I got confused. Instead of the brake, I pressed down on the accelerator.' He blamed the car's semi-automatic transmission for bamboozling him. The identity of the car's owner is not known, although insurance investigators are believed to be looking into the cause of the crash. Only three Ferraris have been designated GTO and only 599 of the latest model were produced. Such is the exclusivity of the 599 GTO, that owners could not simply arrive at their local Ferrari dealership seeking to purchase the model. Instead, they had to be invited by the Italian company to hand over their cash.

The new pet GPS system allows owners to track their furry friends' journeys in real time, from monitoring the temperature below, to whether their cage is upright or askew. The first-of-its-kind technology was developed by Sendum Wireless Corp. and is available for $50 per flight from 10 US airports. Delta's new pet GPS, available for $50 per flight, allows owners to track their pets on a plane via a website . The move was no doubt aimed to make passengers feel safer about bringing their pets with them on flights, as Delta Air Lines has a less than rosy history of pet fatalities on board. Tragically between 2010 and 2013, Delta reported the greatest number of animal incidents and was held responsible for 41 of the 97 reported deaths that year. They maintain that the high numbers are due to the fact they carry a higher number of pets than competitors. The service is available from 10 US airlines including Los Angeles and Atlanta . Two months ago it was reported\u00a0that Delta failed to load a number of show dogs on a flight, and staff admitted they did not know where the prized pets were, when they were asked by customers. The dogs had been competing at the prestigious Westminster Dog Show in New York and were headed for Seattle. Angry passengers disembarked and were given\u00a0a free overnight stay at a hotel near JFK, a refund of their $200 dog fees, VIP service at the airport and spots in the cabin for the dogs for the return flight to Seattle. It is hoped the Sendum Wireless Corp. technology, which has similar trackers for keeping tabs on alcohol and tobacco and to make sure seafood is kept cold, will give owners peace of mind during their travels. Owners of pets at the\u00a0Westminster Dog Show in New York were told their pets were not on board their Delta flight, and disembarked to go and find them .

Dating back hundreds of thousands of years, the instinct to avoid arachnids developed as an evolutionary response to a dangerous threat, the academics suggest. It could mean that arachnophobia, one of the most crippling of phobias, represents a finely tuned survival instinct. And it could date back to early human evolution in Africa, where spiders with very strong venom have existed millions of years ago. Scroll down for video . Researchers say a fear of spiders is a survival trait written into our DNA and dates back thousands of years, Stock photo . Study leader Joshua New, of Columbia University in New York, said: \u2018A number of spider species with potent, vertebratespecific venoms populated Africa long before hominoids and have co-existed there for tens of millions of years. \u2018Humans were at perennial, unpredictable and significant risk of encountering highly venomous spiders in their ancestral environments. \u2018Even when not fatal, a black widow spider bite in the ancestral world could leave one incapacitated for days or even weeks, terribly exposed to dangers,\u2019 he told the Sunday Times. The research team carried out an experiment in which 252 volunteers were asked to study computer screens containing abstract shapes and data. Their reactions to images of spiders were very fast, even if their shape was distorted, when compared to much more clear images of other objects known induce disgust or fear, such as needles and flies. The researchers point out that spiders are often small dark creatures that tend to hide in recesses and are hard to spot. Dr New said: \u2018Detection, therefore, is the critical arbiter of success in such encounters \u2014 any improvements to the sensitivity, vigilance, reliability and speed of faculties for their detection would have been of significant selective advantage.\u2019 The instinct could date back to early human evolution in Africa, where spiders with very strong venom existed millions of years ago.

An experimental cancer drug axed over poor results may have the ability to reverse the effects of Alzheimer's, experts have revealed (file picture) The drug worked by blocking a process that breaks nerve connections in the brain used to store memory. Researchers say the study has led to the launch of human trials to test the efficacy of the drug in Alzheimer's patients. Stephen Strittmatter, the author of the report, published in Annals of Neurology, said: 'With this treatment, cells under bombardment by beta amyloid plaques show restored synaptic connections and reduced inflammation, and the animal\u2019s memory, which was lost during the course of the disease, comes back. The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health which launched a programme to test failed drugs on different diseases. Mr Strittmatter and his co-author Christopher van Dyck have already started a 'multi-site clinical trial' to determine whether the drug can also benefit Alzheimer's patients. According to the Alzheimer's Society, there are 850,000 people with dementia in Britain - a figure that includes 40,000 younger people. The charity estimates that 60,000 deaths are attributable to dementia every year and that there will be one million people with the disease in the UK by 2025. It reports that the financial cost of dementia to the UK is \u00a326billion a year. The Daily Express reports the charity's head of research Dr James Pickett as giving the latest treatment a cautious welcome. He said: 'Drug development can take decades, so repurposing pre-existing drugs for dementia is a promising avenue to find new treatments as they have been shown to be safe to use in people and can lead to clinical trials sooner. 'As we learn more about the causes of dementia, there is hope that treatments we routinely use for other diseases may also work for people with dementia.'", "claim": "The drug was developed by British pharmaceutical giant Astra Zeneca .

Police say the woman from Shelburne, Massachusetts was driving drunk around 10:30pm when she ran off Route 5 in Dummerston, Vermont and crashed her 2011 Toyota Camry into a wooden fence. At the scene, MacDonald told responding officers that she crashed while talking on the phone and trying to take directions down on a legal note pad in her car. But when officers smelled alcohol on MacDonald, they administered a breathalyzer test and she posted a .10 blood-alcohol content - above the state's legal threshold of .08. MacDonald stuck out her tongue for the cheeky picture after she was arrested and brought back to police headquarters on charges of driving while intoxicated. Police say that though MacDonald's car was heavily damaged, neither she or anyone else was injured in the one-vehicle crash. MacDonald was released on a citation and is scheduled back in court on April 28 for an arraignment. Public records do not indicate MacDonald has been arrested for DWI in the past.

Andras Janos Vass, 25, was found guilty of human trafficking and racketeering felonies this week after grooming fellow Hungarians online then keeping them captive in New York City and Miami.

Stocks of the influenza vaccine are arriving a month later than expected as scientists have included protection against Influenza A strain H3N2 and Influenza B strain B/Phuket. The decision to include both was triggered by a spike in flu-related deaths in the northern hemisphere as the vaccine was not a good match to fight against the two types of flu.

High-risk groups - such as the very young and very old, and most indigenous Australians - will be able to access free, government-funded flu shots from April 20. Experts say the modified version of the vaccination is worth waiting for. But Dr Alan Hampson, who chairs the Influenza Specialist Group, said everyone should be getting the vaccine, which also provided protection against Influenza A strain H1N1. He said H3N2 and B/Phuket caused a spike in deaths in Europe and the US during the northern winter because the vaccine available did not provide the right buffer against the diseases. There was a spike in deaths related to H3N2 and B/Phuket in Europe and the US during the northern winter as the vaccine did not cover the strains . World health authorities realised that and modified the vaccine to be used in Australia this winter. 'Our vaccine now should be a really good match for the strains that are circulating globally and we certainly hope we can prevent more deaths per capita than they did,' Dr Hampson told AAP. 'In fact the vaccine that will be used in the next northern winter will be exactly the same as the one we'll be using over the next few weeks.' Dr Hampson said people should be booking their flu shots now, given the delay in stocks arriving.

A man is on the run after police charged him with faking his own kidnapping in a bizarre incident last fall. Police say Clarence Taylor, 44, faked his own kidnapping by duct taping his mouth and tying himself to a tree in Akron, Ohio. On November 1, Taylor's 45-year-old girlfriend called police, saying he had been missing for several days. While she was on the phone with investigators, the girlfriend received a call from another of Taylor's friends who said he had found him tied to a tree with zip ties in a wooded area near Stoner Creek and Pickford Ave. That unidentified man then led police to Taylor, who was strangely still bound to the tree. It's unclear why his friend did not cut him down initially. Police then released Taylor and took him to Akron General Medical Center. Taylor told police that a group of men tied him to the tree after stealing $2,500 from him. He says he was walking down Beechwood Drive when he saw the men with shotguns who abducted took him and took him away in their van. Taylor claimed to have been left tied to the tree for several days, despite not showing any signs of dehydration or injuries consistent with being out in the cold and rainy weather for an extended period of time. Police have since charged Taylor with a first-degree misdemeanor charge of falsification. A warrant was issued for his arrest last month but Taylor remains at large. Police have not revealed the reason for the warrant's four month delay or a motive behind the fake kidnapping. Calls to the Akron, Ohio Police and Summit County, Ohio Sheriff's Office were not immediately returned Monday morning.", "claim": "Police say Clarence Taylor, 44, faked his own kidnapping by duct taping his mouth and tying himself to a tree in Akron, Ohio .

Warning: A sign written in ancient Greek and Latin telling cyclists not to leave their bikes chained to railings has been erected outside a university building in Cambridge .

Puyi became emperor in 1908 when he was two years and ten months old. His abdication ended the rule of the Qing dynasty, which began in 1644. After the government took power in 1912 Puyi and his close family were forced to live within the walls of the Forbidden City, where they retained imperial traditions and were tended to by eunuchs. They were expelled from the palace complex in 1917. Puren established a primary school with the help of his father in the 1940s and continued to teach until he retired in the late 1960s.

Officials ordered 250,000 birds to be slaughtered in Telangana\u00a0after cases of the H5N1 virus were identified, which can be deadly in humans. The virus caused the deaths of nearly 400 people and hundreds of millions of poultry after it spread from Asia into Europe and Africa in 2005-2006. Culled: About 250,000 birds infected with the H5N1 virus are slaughtered in Telangana, India . Since then, India has regularly reported cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza in wild and domestic birds. Veterinary staff from the local government's animal husbandry department carried out the cull - which included destroying hundreds of thousands of infected eggs - at Thorrur village in the Ranga Reddy district. Birds present in poultry farms were slaughtered while the eggs, including those stored in warehouses, were dumped in a pit. Destroyed: Thousands of infected eggs were dumped in a pit and buried following an outbreak of bird flu . Clean up: Authorities ordered the destruction of birds and eggs at farms across\u00a0Telangana in India following the latest bird flu outbreak . Bird feed stock was burned and the sites were all thoroughly disinfected in a bid to stop the virus from spreading. India has culled 6.4 million birds due to bird flu since 2006. Experts point out that cross-infection to humans is still relatively rare and usually occurs where people have been in close contact with infected birds. But fears remain the aviation flu could combine with a human strain to produce a mutation that is more dangerous and difficult to control. In February, three people were tested for bird flu and 10,000 chickens slaughtered in Britain's first outbreak of the H7N7 strain in seven years. There have been several outbreaks of the H7N7 flu in China and 18 months ago it was found in Italy. During the Italian outbreak in August 2013, three poultry workers became infected with the virus, developing conjunctivitis.

In what is the first roll out of the technology throughout Europe, the Wi-Fi Calling feature is designed to facilitate calls and texts when users have no mobile phone signal. The technology paves the way for London's commuters to chat and text inside the capital's 150 Tube stations where Wi-Fi connections are currently available. London's Underground platforms could soon be drowned in the sound of commuters chatting on their phones . iPhone users on EE will find their calls and texts automatically connect through the internet when they have no service signal. An EE spokesman said: 'Starting today, iPhone customers on EE can make and receive high quality calls over WiFi and send text messages, using their own phone number with no need to use an app - great for when a mobile signal is unavailable.' While it is already possible to make phone calls or send messages via Wi-Fi with apps such as WhatsApp and Viber, the new technology works automatically in the user's phone. After having downloaded the update, EE users on iPhone will see a Wi-Fi Calling section appear in the settings app of their phone, which must be switched to allow to enable the feature. The telecoms firm also confirmed that the new Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 edge will also have the feature on the EE network when it goes on sale this Friday.

The jury found Storey liable for some $240,000 of the damages and the county liable for the rest. Storey wrote in 2007, 'I'd love to harvest your sweet grapes,' and called Eisenhour the 'most gorgeous thing alive.'

Crucial to the case was a meeting Ms Eisenhour had with the Court Judge in July 2008 after she had seen the love note. Storey was said to have asked whether she was in a relationship and where she was going on holiday. For Ms Eisenhour this proved the 'last straw' as far as his possessiveness of her was concerned. Storey claimed his worries related to Ms Eisenhour's weight-loss, recent job performance and absences.

Dating back to around 1840, the 10in tall lamp will go under the hammer at Hansons in Etwall, Derbyshire, on June 26. After her experiences in the war Nightingale returned to Derbyshire, where she had spent her childhood, in the 1850s. She wrote of what she had seen in the conflict with her 1859 Notes on Nursing still considered as having shaped the profession today. During the war she became known as The Lady with the Lamp thanks to a report in The Times. She had been sent to Selimiye Barracks in Scutari, now Istanbul, in 1854 to care for soldiers. She pleaded with the British newspaper to appeal to the Government for better working conditions having been horrified by the squalor and disease fighters faced. The result was Renkioi Hospital, a civilian facility built in England and shipped to the area to care for those who had been hurt. It was there Nightingale earned her nickname, carrying a lamp as she completed rounds of the hospital's patients through the night.

Doctors are putting the health of women and their babies at risk by performing caesarean sections too readily, UN officials warn. They say the procedure should only be carried out when \u2018medically necessary\u2019 because it can lead to infections and even death. Just over a quarter of women giving birth in England now have a caesarean and the rate has more than doubled since the early 1990s. This includes a growing number of women opting to have planned caesareans because they are very anxious about giving birth naturally. But last night experts from the World Health Organisation, the UN\u2019s public health agency, said this figure should ideally be between just 10 per cent and 15 per cent, due to the dangers and costs involved. In a statement, they said: \u2018Although it can save lives, caesarean section is often performed without medical need, putting women and their babies at risk of short- and long-term health problems.\u2019 They added that the procedure can lead to \u2018significant complications, disability or death\u2019 and diverts precious money away from the needs of other patients. A planned caesarean costs the NHS an average of \u00a32,369, compared to a natural birth at \u00a31,665. The WHO statement sharply contradicts current NHS guidelines, which say the procedure should be offered to women even when there is no medical justification.

Just over a quarter of women giving birth in England now have a caesarean and the rate has more than doubled since the early 1990s . Women are also advised to have planned caesareans if they have had a previous complicated birth, are over 40 or have a medical condition such as asthma, diabetes or depression. But the WHO said that doctors were carrying them out too often, and underestimating the risks.

Special delivery: The first batch of asparagus of the season was placed in a can and attached to a drone . 'You think you have a cool idea with a drone \u2013 how original can you be? Picking up asparagus with a drone,' Mr Peijenburg told Netherlands regional broadcaster Omroep Brabant. 'This is very, very sad because it was an amateur pilot, the owner of the drone, who organised this especially for me and brings his own toys. So this wasn't supposed to happen of course.' The pilot had followed the remote-controlled craft in the back of a pick-up truck while the stunt was filmed by a local TV channel. The Dutch restaurant had to settle for a more traditional method of delivery following the crash. Personal drones have surged in popularity with\u00a0Amazon alone selling 10,000 of them every month. However, learning to fly a drone \u2014 flying devices that often carry cameras and can be navigated remotely by smartphones or controllers \u2014 is something that requires some time and patience say experts.

The other boldface name in the group is Google, which comes in at no. 13 and pays an median of $143,000 a year. But to make it on to the payrolls of these top companies, workers needs to be highly educated, highly skilled or highly connected - sometimes all three. They fall into three categories - tech companies, law firms and consulting firms. Netflix has come a long way from its days of mailing DVDs to subscribers across the country. Its 2,000 employees have a median salary of $180,000 now . Nine of the top 15 companies are in the tech sector, according to salary data compiled by the recruiting company Glassdoor.com. These firms are competing furiously to hire and retain the relatively small number of top-notch computer programmers who make Silicon Valley such a magnet for money. Consulting and law firms rely on relationships with clients and so once employees establish themselves, they become more and more valuable and command higher salaries. Wall Street law firm, Skadden, Arps, one of the largest and most prestigious law firms in the nation, comes in at the top of the list. The median compensation there there is $182,000. Skadden has 4,500 employees - more than 1,800 of whom are high-grossing attorneys. Netflix, which has 2,000 employees, comes in second. Management consultants take the three spots - Strategy&, McKinsey & Company and A.T. Kearney all pay $160,000 median salaries. Mozilla, the company that oversees the Firefox web browser and TureCar, which lists car sales, are both on the list. Other than Google, Netflix, Mozilla and TrueCar, most people have likely not heard of the companies of the highest-paid list. The companies are also mostly small and midsize.

Coleman and British Airways created several videos - tailored to pre-flight, mid-flight, and pre-arrival exercises - which will be available on board for all fliers to view. He recommends wearing comfortable clothing, choosing lighter meals on board, moderating alcohol, coffee and tea intake and 'gentle exercising,' such as stretching, during the flight. Coleman also advocates strategic napping to help travellers adjust to a different time zone and feel revitalised upon landing.

The loophole came to light after trading standards officers raided restaurant The Royal China Club, on Baker Street in central London, and confiscated illegally imported fins. Charity Bite-Back, which campaigns to protect sharks, reported the eatery after Jason Chan, its marketing manager, boasted that it sold the soup and another dish made with ground shark teeth. Scroll down for video . The revelations come after the Royal China Club, a restaurant in central London, was raided by inspectors after boasting of selling shark fin soup and another dish made from ground shark teeth . Charity workers say that restaurants are either disguising the soup (pictured) on their menus as 'fish fin soup', or are offering it to Mandarin speaking customers if they ask . More than 70 million sharks are killed each year for their fins, often dying slow, painful deaths after being dumped back into the sea once their most valuable parts have been cut off. Graham Buckingham, campaign director at Bite-Back, told The Times he was disappointed that The Royal China Club was not fined for their breach. He added: 'There's never any big penalty for this type of discovery and even if trading standards had chosen to prosecute, the fines are described as minimal.' Charity Bite-Back believes as many as one in five Chinese restaurants are selling the soup after exploiting a loophole which allows people to bring 20kg of fins into the country if they are for personal consumption .

Debra and Dale Krein (pictured) have been awarded $240,000 after complaining that their neighbors' Tibetan mastiffs have caused them more than a decade of disquiet by barking until 5am .

Finally, after three years of proceedings, a jury has ruled in favor of the disgruntled Oregonians, ordering for the canines to be debarked within 60 days. Debarking is a surgical operation that reduces tissue in the vocal chords. The procedure lowers the volume of a dog's bark. The Kreins claimed their lives have been plagued by the noise since the defendants, John Updegraff and Karen Szewc, started breeding dogs in 2002. According to the Mail Tribune, the canines would routinely bark until 5am and throughout the day outside the property just 300 feet from the Kreins. The jury ruled that the Tibetan mastiffs (stock image), born in 2002, should have their vocal chords removed . Irritation: The Kreins' property (right) is less than 300 meters from Updegraff and Szewc (center), who claim to keep livestock on their sprawling land.

This continued, they told the court, despite the fact that Updegraff and Szewc were cited by Jackson County Animal Control in 2002 and 2004 for violating public nuisance codes.

Researchers found that heart patients who expressed gratitude for the positive things in their life had improved mental, and ultimately physical, health. The study involved men and women who had been diagnosed with Stage B heart failure. Heart patients who expressed gratitude for the positive things in their life had better mental and physical health, a study found . Stage B is where patients have developed structural heart disease - they may, for example, have had a heart attack that damaged the heart - but do not show symptoms of heart failure, such as shortness of breath or fatigue. It is important to make beneficial lifestyle changes at this stage because patients are at a high risk of progressing to Stage C heart failure - where risk of death is five times higher - the researchers said. The 186 patients were assessed for their levels of gratitude using standard psychological tests. These scores were then compared with the patients\u2019 scores for depressive symptoms, sleep quality, fatigue, self-efficacy (belief in our ability to deal with a situation) and inflammatory markers. Inflammation can often worsen heart failure. \u2018We found that more gratitude in these patients was associated with better mood, better sleep, less fatigue and lower levels of inflammatory biomarkers related to cardiac health,\u2019 said Professor Paul Mills, from the University of California. Patients who were more grateful had lower markers of inflammation, which can worsen heart failure . To further test their findings, the researchers asked some of the patients to write down three things for which they were thankful most days of the week for eight weeks. Both groups continued to receive their normal clinical care during that time. \u2018We found that those patients who kept gratitude journals for those eight weeks showed reductions in circulating levels of several important inflammatory biomarkers, as well as an increase in heart rate variability while they wrote,\u2019 said Professor Mills. \u2018Improved heart rate variability is considered a measure of reduced cardiac risk. \u2018It seems that a more grateful heart is indeed a more healthy heart, and that gratitude journaling is an easy way to support cardiac health.\u2019 The research was published in the journal Spirituality in Clinical Practice.", "claim": "Heart patients who expressed gratitude for the positive things in their life had better mental and physical health, a study found .

Investigators have been scouring Lubitz's computers to determine his state of mind before the tragedy . Lubitz remained silent during the final eight minutes of the flight as it flew into the Alps . Once Captain Sodenheimer closed the cockpit door, Lubitz enabled special security features preventing the reinforced door from reopening. The safety systems were introduced following the 9/11 attacks although the designers did not consider a rogue pilot seeking to kill himself while taking his passengers and fellow crew with him. Already it has emerged that Lubitz used his computer to research methods of killing himself as well as information concerning the cockpit door locking mechanism. It is understood that European safety chiefs had concerns about Germanwings' safety procedures in the weeks before the crash. In November 2014, the European Commission contacted several airlines and 'had asked for clarification to make sure all airlines actively observe rules'. Following the crash, it emerged that Lubtiz suffered from crippling depression although Lufthansa, who own Germanwings, did not pass on this information to aviation regulators. Investigators believe that Lubitz, 27, informed its flight school when he returned from a several-month break in pilot training in 2009 that he had experienced an episode of 'severe depression'. Lufthansa has said he subsequently passed all medical tests. The EU has detailed air safety regulations, which included rules on a pilot's mental health, that member states need to take into account.

A team of researchers at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee explored how best to minimise the risk of infection after surgery. They note that despite hand washing and other protocols, surgical-site infections continue to pose a problem. Children's toys could act as a reservoir for bacteria and bring germs into hospitals, scientists at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, have warned . The researchers concluded this implied one of two scenarios. Firstly, that current infection prevention methods are not effective. And secondly that there are alternative sources of bacterial exposure to the surgical wound. Their study revealed that soft toys brought into the operating theatre by children served as a breeding ground for bacteria. They urged parents to be aware of the dangers comfort items could pose, and take steps to eradicate the risk. Dr Jonathan Schoenecker and his team aimed to investigate if cuddly toys contribute to surgical-site infections. They swabbed stuffed animals that were brought into hospital by children ahead of surgery. The findings revealed that all those soft toys swabbed showed bacterial growth. In addition, the researchers demonstrated that a single wash and dry cycle at home, followed by sealing the toy in a plastic bag for 24 hours, effectively 'sterilised' 79 per cent of those soft toys tested. Researchers urged parents to wash and sterilise their child's toys before bringing them into the operating theatre, to help minimise the risk of their child suffering a surgical-site infection . The study report states: 'These results indicate that items of comfort, such as stuffed animals, brought into the operating room with a benevolent purpose may represent a reservoir of bacteria that could lead to unwanted surgical-site infections. 'Washing an item of comfort one day before surgery effectively sterilises that item.' The researchers note that future studies will be needed to determine the correlation between stuffed animals that test positive for bacteria and surgical-site infections. Another area to look at is whether giving a child a 'sterile' soft toy reduces the risk of surgical-site infections.", "claim": "Vanderbilt University researchers swabbed stuffed animals before surgery .

A thief who tricked his way into students' homes to steal their belongings was caught when he left his old police charge sheet behind which had his name written on it. Ricky Woolaston, 35, posed as a university maintenance engineer to gain access to students' properties before pinching laptops and mobile phones to feed his drug habit. But a court heard he was easily tracked down by police after he left behind his bag at the scene of one of the crimes. Officers searched the rucksack and found it contained a police charge sheet from a previous offence bearing his name and address. The prolific thief was arrested last Friday, and has now been sentenced to four years in prison at Birmingham Crown Court after pleading guilty to five burglaries. The court heard unemployed Woolaston would walk around the University of Birmingham campus wearing clothes bearing the red-brick university's logo. But he was caught out when he broke into the Biosciences Department on January 29 where he forced open two secure metal cupboards. Nothing was stolen but Woolaston, from Erdington, Birmingham, left behind the bag containing the charge sheet. Police were then able to pin four other burglaries on him with the help of students who  positively identified him. After the case, Detective Constable Jon Green, from West Midlands Police, said: 'Woolaston targeted students at Birmingham University in order to feed his drug habit.

{"id": 1930, "text": "Whether or not a person suffers hearing loss due to loud noise may depend on their genes, research suggests. Noise-induced hearing loss is\u00a0one of the most common work-related illnesses and members of the armed forces are\u00a0particularly vulnerable. In 2013, the US Department of Veterans Affairs reported hearing loss as one of the most common ailments among veterans receiving disability compensation. Noise-induced hearing loss is one of the most common work-related illnesses, doctors have warned . Now, however, scientists at the University of Southern California believe they have made a breakthrough in their understanding of the condition. They have identified a gene, named Nox3, found in the inner ear, that is crucial in determining how vulnerable a person is to developing hearing loss. Their research, looking at the DNA of mice exposed to noise, is the first published genome-wide association study on noise-induced hearing loss in mice. As a result of the findings, those at higher, genetic risk for hearing loss can decide whether to take precautionary measures to protect their hearing prior to hazardous noise exposure, the study authors say. 'Understanding the biological processes that affect susceptibility to hearing loss due to loud noise exposure is an important factor in reducing the risk,' said lead study author Professor Rick Friedman. 'We have made great advances in hearing restoration, but nothing can compare to protecting the hearing you have and preventing hearing loss in the first place.' Scientists have identified a gene, named Nox3, found in the inner ear, that is crucial in determining how vulnerable a person is to developing hearing loss . While some gene association studies on noise-induced hearing loss in people have been conducted in the past, all were very small and their results unreplicated. Genome wide association studies search the entire DNA for common mutations to see if any of those are linked with a trait. Mouse genome wide association studies have lead to the discovery of hundreds of genes involved in complex traits that have immediate relevance to people. The study was published in the journal PLOS Genetics. An earlier version of this piece existed but has now been amended.", "claim": "Noise-induced hearing loss is one of the most common work-related illnesses .

She added that beginning when she was nine years old up until she was 13, Rebbie would come into her bedroom while she was sleeping and molest her, according to Philly.com. Investigators found 41 videos from the hidden camera that included footage of the girl and others while they used the bathroom, 34 of which showed victims as they showered. Rebbie uploaded the videos, some that included close-up images of children's genitalia, to his computer to view later, prosecutors said. The videos were captured over a three- or four-year time period, according to prosecutors. Rebbie admitted to filming several victims, including other juveniles, but had purchased the camera specifically so he could record the now-15-year-old victim while she undressed and showered, according to the Pottstown Mercury.

The news comes as cigar use rises in the US, where the study was carried out, and cigarette smoking declines. Alarmingly, more young people appear to be taking up cigars thanks to new ranges of flavoured ones. Researchers have warned that cigars may be more harmful to smokers than cigarettes. They found the risk for cigar smokers of dying from oral, oesophageal or lung cancer was at least as bad as for cigarettes . Cigar consumption more than doubled from 6.2billion in 2000 to more than 13.7billion in 2011 \u2013 in contrast with a 33 per cent fall for cigarettes. Researchers analysed 22 studies, including five from Britain, and found the risks for cigar smokers of dying from oral, oesophageal or lung cancer was at least as bad as for cigarettes. They also found that those who smoked cigars and had previously smoked cigarettes had a much higher risk of lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease compared to cigar smokers who had not previously smoked cigarettes.

Schmidt also pocketed a $1.25 million salary, a $6 million bonus and perks valued at nearly $1 million. His total pay last year soared by more than five-fold from 2013 when his Google compensation was valued at $19.3 million. The hefty raise came in a year that saw Google's stock drop by 5 percent amid investor concerns about the company's big spending on far-flung projects. Analysts have also questioned whether Google will be able to maintain its dominance in Internet search as more people rely on smartphones instead of personal computers to access digital content. The downturn in Google's stock contrasted with an 11 percent gain in the Standard & Poor's 500 index last year. Schmidt, 59, already is among the world's richest people with an estimated fortune of $9 billion, according to Forbes. Most of his wealth has been built on the Google stock that he began accumulating when he became the Mountain View, California, company's CEO in 2001. The Associated Press calculates executive compensation by including salary, bonuses, perks, above-market interest that the company pays on deferred compensation, and the estimated value of stock and stock options awarded during the year.

The amount of drugs being thrown over the fence into one prison is so high that warders have been forced to deploy a cherry picker to remove them. Packages containing heroin and cannabis were cleared from the roof of HMP Altcourse in Liverpool - hurled there from the outside by friends of inmates who missed their intended targets. The hydraulic crane also recovered so-called 'legal highs' as well as 22 phones, three Sim cards and six chargers from the 60ft roof, contained in a total of 14 bubble-wrapped packages. Officers at the jail, privately run by controversial firm G4S, disclosed the haul in an internal document, which dramatically highlights the extent of drug use among the jail's 1,300 inmates. Dave Thompson, director of the Category B prison, said: 'These items were thrown over the prison walls by criminals on the outside and it required a cherry picker and staff to retrieve them from inaccessible rooftops.' Altcourse, the first prison in the UK to be designed and constructed for a private operator, has been criticised for drug-related violence. After a three-day visit last June, chief inspector of prisons Chris Hardwick wrote: 'There have been 38 serious assaults in just four months before the inspection. Gang issues and the availability of drugs, particularly new psychoactive substances [legal highs] were a significant factor in much of the violence.' G4S insists that Altcourse runs an effective anti-smuggling operation, and that the cherry picker is part of a 'high-visibility' approach to show inmates they will 'root out packages from anywhere'.

The broccoli chemical sulforaphane is known to block the inflammation and damage to cartilage associated with the condition. But patients would have to eat several pounds of the vegetable every day to derive any significant benefit. Sulforaphane in its natural form is also too unstable to turn into a medicine. But UK drug company Evgen Pharma has developed a stable synthetic version of the chemical that offers the potential of a pill treatment. A single dose of the drug, known as Sulforadex or SFX-01, is the equivalent of eating 5.5lb of broccoli in one day.

A beggar has been ordered to pay \u00a320 to a 12-year-old girl after intimidating her into handing over the last 15p of her pocket money. The frightened youngster was confronted by homeless Isa Richardson who claimed she needed money because her car had broken down, a court heard.

The court ordered her to pay \u00a320 to the young victim because of the stress she was forced to endure in the  incident. Richardson was caught and arrested on March 19 after CCTV operators were alerted to her suspicious behaviour as they spotted her approaching people for cash. She told the court she was in such a desperate financial situation that she believed her only options were to either beg or shoplift. She also told the court she deeply regretted upsetting the youngster. Magistrates heard she owed \u00a3375 in outstanding fines and costs from previous crimes but had started receiving benefits and was looking for a job to start paying off the debt. Homeless Richardson was also given a 12-month conditional discharge. Debbie Jones, prosecuting, said she had already been convicted of similar offences twice this year.

The man in his 50s, who has only been named as Mr Zhang, was travelling on his three-wheeled motorbike in Dezhou City in east China when he was hit by a car at a busy junction and thrown off his bike. Villagers from Shoma Ying said that his younger brother had been on the same junction last August, when a collision with a lorry killed him instantly, according to the People's Daily Online. Tragic: The man, only named as Mr Zhang, was thrown off his motorbike when he was hit by a car. He later died in hospital from his injuries . Freak coincidence: His brother had died at the same junction eight months earlier after colliding with a lorry . Mr Zhang, the elder of the two brothers, was taken to hospital for his injuries but died shortly after. The silver car that hit Mr Zhang on his motorbike when he pulled out of the junction sped away from the scene without stopping. A driver who witnessed the accident tried to chase after the car but eventually lost it in traffic. Mr Zhang, who was unmarried, sold vegetables at the local market and was believed to use the stretch of road on a daily basis. Leftover vegetables were found in the trailer after the accident, which was found 30 metres away from the crushed motorbike. Shu Rongli, a police officer from the Dezhou City Public Security Bureau, said that the newly constructed road was not open yet and did not even have road signs. Aftermath: The trailer of the motorbike was found 30 metres away from the main vehicle . Poignant: Vegetables sold by Mr Zhang at the local market were found in the trailer after the crash . He added that those using it were doing so illegally. The driver in the silver car, who was using a fake registration plate, is under investigation by the police.

During the video, the noise made by the phone is responded to with chirps from the ducklings. As the first bird moves towards him the firefighter, also armed with a torch, dived headfirst further into the drain and emerges with the panicked baby duck cupped in his hand. The adorable animal, who is also chirping away in a noise remarkably similar to the ringtone, is then passed to another officer standing above the storm drain. It took Mr Knecht 90 minutes to catch the first four ducklings during the rescue mission in the southeast Louisiana community of Slidell. But two members of the agitated gang needed more time to calm down and were not rescued until an hour later. All six ducklings were reunited with their mother on Saturday at their home on a nearby canal. Bizarrely it was the station's second duck rescue in a week - as on April 19, firefighters rescued a duck that got stuck in a chimney.
